Netflix Clone

About
Welcome to the Netflix Clone repository! This project is a recreation of the popular streaming platform Netflix, designed to showcase my skills in web development and frontend technologies. With this clone, I aim to provide users with a familiar and user-friendly interface that resembles the Netflix experience.

Features

Dynamic Content: It fetches real movie and TV show data using the Netflix API to display a wide range of content, complete with posters, trailers, and descriptions.

Trailer Playback: Watch trailers by clicking on movie or TV show posters.

Categories: Explore content organized by categories like "Action," "Comedy," "Drama," and more.

Technologies Used
This project is built using a variety of technologies, including:

HTML5 and CSS3 for the frontend structure and styling.
JavaScript for the dynamic behavior and interactivity.
React for building the user interface and handling state.
