About
Welcome to the Netflix Clone repository! This project is a recreation of the popular streaming platform Netflix, designed to showcase my skills in web development and frontend technologies. With this clone, I aim to provide users with a familiar and user-friendly interface that resembles the Netflix experience.

Features
Responsive Design: This Netflix clone is built to be responsive, ensuring a seamless viewing experience on a variety of devices, from desktops to smartphones.

Dynamic Content: It fetches real movie and TV show data using the Netflix API to display a wide range of content, complete with posters, trailers, and descriptions.

User Authentication: Users can create accounts, sign in, and enjoy a personalized experience. User data is securely stored and managed.

Search Functionality: Easily find your favorite movies and TV shows with a powerful search feature.

Trailer Playback: Watch trailers by clicking on movie or TV show posters.

Categories: Explore content organized by categories like "Action," "Comedy," "Drama," and more.

Watchlists: Users can add movies and TV shows to their watchlists to keep track of what they want to watch later.

Reviews and Ratings: Leave reviews and ratings for movies and TV shows.
